## ‚úÖ Description

This pull request adds the full implementation of a C# console-based Examination System.

Key features include:
- Array-based question management
- Event-driven student notification
- Final exam handling and grading logic
- Use of inheritance, interfaces, file I/O, and enums

## üìù Additional Notes

- The event model used for student notifications is based on C# delegates.
- File naming for question logs uses timestamps for uniqueness.
- Project is currently console-only, but can be upgraded to WPF or ASP.NET in future versions.
