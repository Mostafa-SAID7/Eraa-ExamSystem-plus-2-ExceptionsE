## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Open the project in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.**
2. **Ensure all `.cs` files are included in the project.**
3. **Build and run the application.**
4. On execution, the program will:
   - Ask how many questions you want.
   - Add different types of questions automatically.
   - Start the exam.
   - Notify all registered students.
   - Accept student answers and calculate the grade.

## ðŸ“– Key Concepts Used

- **Abstract Classes & Inheritance**
- **Interfaces (`ICloneable`, `IComparable`)**
- **Array-based collections (not using `List<T>`)**
- **Event Handling & Delegates**
- **File Logging**
- **XML Documentation Comments**
- **Exam Correction with a `Dictionary<Question, Answer>`**

## ðŸ”§ Customization Ideas

- Add more question types.
- Save exam results to a CSV or database.
- Implement timers.
- Build a GUI version using WinForms or WPF.
- Allow dynamic question creation instead of hardcoded ones.
